We say an infinite sequence a0,a1,a2,… is non-increasing if and only if for all i≥0, ai≥ai+1.

There is an infinite right and down grid. The upper-left cell has coordinates (0,0). Rows are numbered 0 to infinity from top to bottom, columns are numbered from 0 to infinity from left to right.

There is also a non-increasing infinite sequence a0,a1,a2,…. You are given a0, a1, …, an; for all i>n, ai=0. For every pair of x, y, the cell with coordinates (x,y) (which is located at the intersection of x-th row and y-th column) is white if y<ax and black otherwise.

Initially there is one doll named Jina on (0,0). You can do the following operation.

Select one doll on (x,y). Remove it and place a doll on (x,y+1) and place a doll on (x+1,y).
Note that multiple dolls can be present at a cell at the same time; in one operation, you remove only one. Your goal is to make all white cells contain 0 dolls.

What's the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the goal? Print the answer modulo 109+7.
